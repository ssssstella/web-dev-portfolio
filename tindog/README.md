# Tindog

A Javascript app that let you swipe and get potential dog matches.

Practiced:
- Class
- constructor function
- arrow function
- setTimeout() method
- ternary operator


The bits that made me think quite a while:
1. putting the like/nope badge on top of the dog profile picture, had a better idea about the stack order of html elements, aka, the mystrerious z-index
2. putting bio info over the dog profile picture, "position: absolute" for child elements while "position: relative" for parent element
3. release focus state after button clicked, .blur() method
