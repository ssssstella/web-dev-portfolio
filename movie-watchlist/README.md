# Movie watchlist app

A Javascript app that let you search movies in real-time and add your picks into a watchlist.

Practiced:
- callbacks
- promises
- interact with APIs
- css styling & layout
- async/await

The bits that made me think quite a while:
1. an async function always returns a promise. await "unwraps" a promise and either result in the value the promise was resolved with or throws an error if the promise was rejected.
2. when making two flex child items of texts with different sizes align on the same height, use "vertical-align: text-bottom".
